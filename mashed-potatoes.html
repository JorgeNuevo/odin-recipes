            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover with cold, generously salted water 
                        and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 20-30 minutes 
                        until the potatoes are tender and can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain, 
                        return to the pot, or place in a large mixing bowl.<p></p></li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter in a small saucepan over low heat until melted. Stir in 
                        the buttermilk until <em>just</em> warmed through. Promptly remove from the heat and 
                        stir in the herbs.<p></p></li>
                    <li>With a potato masher or large fork, smash the potatoes until they are mostly broken down, 
                        then drizzle on the buttermilk mixture and mash until combined. Stir in the sour cream.<p></p></li>
                    <li>Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Serve warm with extra butter and a sprinkle of fresh herbs. 
                        Enjoy!!<p></p></li>
