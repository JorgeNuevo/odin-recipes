        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse
                 quality.</p><p>You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized
                  on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New York Strip</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Rosemary & Thyme</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
                <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
                <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to 
                    turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
                <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon
                     garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness</li>
                <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
            </ol>
